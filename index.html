<p>Big Hank, our RV is usually on the road this time of year for family weekend trips and excursions, but for now we&rsquo;re just sticking close to home while we save some money for an upgraded electrics and boondock friendly goodies to come.</p>

<p>Because <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780544839649">Shift (Silo Trilogy)</a> continues where Season 2 of the Apple TV+ series leaves off, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself and ran to check this out from my local library.</p>
<p>Amazing how sometimes novels can uncannily mirror current events &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t put this one down, reading 500+ pages over the course of a week. It&rsquo;s a page turner to say the least, and I&rsquo;m eagerly awaiting my time with the final book in the trilogy, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780544838260?title=Dust&amp;author=Hugh+Howey&amp;cover_id=215441">Dust</a>.</p>

			 <p>Q: should I wait for others to stand with me if I see injustice?</p>
<p>A: Always be the change you want to see. Just like you, people are also waiting for someone to back them up for calling out injustice or waiting for it to hit personally.  But as my old man told me growing up, “study long, study wrong.”</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from “They thought they were free,” a book recounting the lives of the everyday people living in Nazi Germany to illustrate my point:</p>
<p>_&ldquo;Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk alone; you don’t want to “go out of your way to make trouble.” Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.</p>
<p>Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, “everyone” is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, “It’s not so bad” or “You’re seeing things” or “You’re an alarmist.”</p>
<p>And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.</p>
<p>But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.</p>
<p>But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the “German Firm” stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.</p>
<p>And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying “Jewish swine,” collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.</p>
<p>Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.&quot;_</p>
<p>Yes, this post is written very much through the lens of current events, and no you are not crazy for thinking “why the fuck are people not out in the streets yet?”</p>
<p>Everybody is waiting for something that has already happened under their noses. You couldn’t see the forest for the trees. There was no big explosion, just a silent scream and the reality shifted almost imperceptibly for most of us, except those who were looking (like me).</p>
<p>The swamp <em>was</em> drained! …and they replaced it with their own alligators.</p>

<p>The beans symbolize planting seeds of success to grow in the coming year, greens for health and wealth, and neckbones meaning &ldquo;making something outta nothing&rdquo; since these used to be the “throwaway” part of the pig.</p>
<p>Most of us do this every new year and down South, White folks, Hispanic folks, Asian folks, lots of us do it because the Culture spread like that. It’s one of the things l like about living down here: we all have a lot more in common than different.</p>

<p>My ancestry commands my fingers to talk about how my mama grabbed my shoulders as we watched the latest horrors coming from both Gaza and Ukraine last week. &ldquo;Those people were already living in an open prison. Now they have nothing. It&rsquo;s nothing but kids playing in fucking rubble, and they kill the children. It reminds me that bullshit I grew up in,&rdquo; my mother ranted. She&rsquo;s 78 and feisty AF. Anything&hellip; The tiniest little shred of a scrap that makes her remember segregation, Jim Crow and the humiliations she, my family and Black folks in general went through in her childhood and before sets her all the way off. And all the imagery coming in from that part of the world is looking like a 2024 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make Apartheid great again: Genocidal Tendencies&rdquo; double feature for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, I remember they didn&rsquo;t mind you spending up all your money in their big fancy department store downtown, but don&rsquo;t let you have to go to the bathroom. Even a 6-year-old little black girl still has to pee in the alley behind the store, but oh they take that greenback quick. These people aren&rsquo;t allowed to go to a hospital on the other side of the wall, but I bet their taxes are paying something for that. I bet their taxes probably funded that wall, those police and bullets that kill them too!&rdquo; My mama was on a roll, and it might not seem as if her raging actually has a connection to the suffering going on here and now in 2024&hellip;</p>
<p>But suffering knows suffering, and that&rsquo;s the point. Looking at videos of dead kids that were playing foosball in the street a minute ago, looking at sacks of dead bodies being unearthed from mass graves. Seeing 5-year-old boys with soulless eyes dazed because literally their entire household was killed except them&hellip; If I had the same memories my mom (and dad) had, I&rsquo;d be channeling them too. The movie is the same, the characters are just a bit different. It&rsquo;s even worse for me since I don&rsquo;t have those memories first-hand, but I have parents, had grandparents, and have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->felt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> those aches in the collective memory with every song, prayer and hand-laying in those times we Black folks commune together. I do know what it&rsquo;s like to see a friend who spent literally the last 6 hours of their life in school with me, ate lunch with me, played basketball with me, and died from a stray bullet 3 blocks from our school because someone just had to shoot at somebody they didn&rsquo;t like and hit everyone and everything including my friend but totally missed their intended target. Repeat this a few times with some other neighborhood friends, 3 cousins, and so on&hellip; So, tangentially I guess I also know a bit of what a war feels like, and the unfair pain and suffering caused by someone else who I&rsquo;ll never get a reason from let alone an apology. And if I feel this pain, then surely the people causing it must have a hatred so deep that their own sadness is consumes it and makes it do these horrible things.</p>
<p>If we do nothing to stem the outpouring of hatefulness, it won&rsquo;t stop until it&rsquo;s consumed all of humanity.</p>

			 <p>Was a busy (two) week(s) since the last one, so let&rsquo;s catch up with happenings:</p>
<p>🎂 March 20th and 31st marks &ldquo;Birthday Week&rdquo; with the fam, as it&rsquo;s BoyType and MonkeyGirl&rsquo;s turns to celebrate getting one year older. And me and SuperWife&rsquo;s time to be broke AF. BoyType wanted a miniPC for his birthday to tinker on so he combined all his loot and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bought one on his own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after making sure it could FortNight OK; he wanted to be able to play with his schoolmates. (Don&rsquo;t tell him I was going to make sure he could play on my Xbox when he told me the first time, but this is a better way since I want him to learn to troubleshoot technology.) MonkeyGirl wanted cashola plain and simple. The big issue this time was me trying to pay lots of bills and have some cash left for our trip and then some foolishness happened that delayed me hooking her up with her gift for a few days, annoying the newly minted 11-year-old. I said, &ldquo;get used to having deferred dreams for the sake of necessities, especially in this family,&rdquo; which is a lesson she needs to understand as she learns how to manage money. In my own childhood, my parents were constantly using my allowance stash like a petty cash pot to cover bills and things that would come outta nowhere, so I got used to waiting well past my allowance days to &ldquo;make a withdrawal;&rdquo; at least until I was able to get a bank account. She&rsquo;s got her own account we monitor, and a lot more scratch in it than I did when I was 11&ndash; I&rsquo;m making sure it doesn&rsquo;t burn a hole in her pocket now.</p>
<p>🎌 One of my BFFs came back home for a visit with his wife and kiddo. He&rsquo;s from Atlanta, spent lots of time in Japan and both moved back at the same time in 2008. He&rsquo;s still there in fact, settling down for the long haul and I had done the same until we came back in 2021 (but I&rsquo;ll tell that story another day.) They wanted to know what it&rsquo;s like to stay in a RV so we set BigHank up for a driveway camp for them. Other than the water pump being broken because stupid me didn&rsquo;t winterize it well enough, it made a good guest house for them. So glad to see him again and catch up with everyone. Of the things I miss the most about JapanLife, kicking it with my friends is the biggest.</p>
<p>🤦🏾‍♂️ After our guests left, we had one day to prep for our spring break trip to Jacksonville. Thanks to the aforementioned water pump issue, we wanted to get it fixed before getting on the road, and in our haste SuperWife and I didn&rsquo;t properly lock the cargo &ldquo;basement&rdquo; hatch. To make a long story short, our spare tire slid out of there along with a few items all just 300m up the road but by the time we noticed, of course it was gone. Who could pass up a perfectly good <!-- raw HTML omitted -->commercial grade tire &amp; rim<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just lying on the corner of the road like that? I&rsquo;ll be buying a replacement before we head on our next journey in May; until then, are there any Pick-A-Part specials for these things?</p>
<p>🏖 We made it to Jacksonville Beach without any troubles actually. I&rsquo;ll be posting a more detailed trip report in the next few days, but here are some snaps for your consideration:

<p>And that&rsquo;s all I got, see ya next week! 👋🏾</p>

			 <p>I needed a way to have a decent taxonomy for my posts on this incarnation of the blog, especially given its social features. A few places I hang out in online were using a dead-simple method for categorizing their posts and making it easy to find the stuff they saved later on, called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post Kinds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post kinds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are a way of categorizing different types of posts on the web, based on the IndieWeb standards<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Hang on, let me explain that too&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The IndieWeb is a movement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that advocates for people to own their own data and identity online, rather than relying on third-party platforms<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post kinds can help users express themselves in various ways, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->such as replying, liking, bookmarking, reading, listening, watching, and more<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Post kinds also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enable richer interactions between websites, by using webmentions and microformats<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to send and receive notifications and display contextual information<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The tool I&rsquo;m using to make this easier is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Shanske&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post Kinds Plugin for WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This plugin adds a taxonomy called Kind to the WordPress editor and allows users to fill in the blanks for the relevant properties of each kind of post. It also automatically parses URLs to display rich context and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->integrates with the Webmention Plugin to send and receive webmentions<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->5<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Post kinds are not the same as post formats, which are a WordPress feature that allows users to choose a format for their posts, such as standard, aside, image, video, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post formats are more limited<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and less semantic than post kinds, and do not support the IndieWeb standards<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>While not implemented on my site, post kinds can be determined by an algorithm called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Post Type Discovery<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which looks at the content properties and values of a post, rather than an explicit post type property. This way, the post kind can be inferred from the combination of text, media, and other elements in the post, without requiring the user to specify what kind of post they are creating<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Post kinds are a powerful and flexible way of creating and interacting with content on the web, following the IndieWeb principles of owning your data, expressing yourself, and connecting with others, which is definitely what I&rsquo;m trying to achieve with this webiste.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the different kinds of post kinds that I&rsquo;m actively using:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Have a look-see at the different posts above (some aren&rsquo;t populated yet) and you&rsquo;ll get a sense for what I&rsquo;m trying to do here.</p>
<p>Also give me some advice&ndash; how do you/would <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do it?  Use the syndication links (next to the 📡🔀 icon) and let me know.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->source: Atlanta Journal Constitution dated 3 Dec 2023<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Everyone knows that these tax breaks should be going to fund any development that directly enhances the livelihood of Atlanta residents and for no other purpose. Job creation, educational, cultural and infrastructure enhancement are all good reasons to consider giving a company a tax break as an incentive to be here and will soon show up tangibly as residents have easier ways to get around, are better educated, healthier and of course prosperous. This equates to a win-win as it usually shows a bump in tax revenues a few years later.</p>
<p>However since X&rsquo;s datacenter currently only has 24 full-time staff and no other staff are planned on being hired, there&rsquo;s really no reason to give away $10 million + of our tax bucks that really need to be spent on the things I outlined above.</p>
<p>I agree with @threadatl@threads.net when he says:</p>

<p>We have to shake this culture of &ldquo;giveaway to play&rdquo; when it comes to our civic monies and assets unless they directly, tangibly, OSTENSIBLY provide benefit to ALL within the boundaries of the city/county/state&rsquo;s taxpayers.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it did not pass, likely due to a lot of councilmembers suddenly hearing about it from their constituents I&rsquo;ll bet:</p>

<p>His post is massively detailed and as pointed as one would expect of having to literally defend their graduate thesis even after half of it has been edified.

<p>Having the Beltline without tracks is like having a building with no door or airport with no runway and apparently even Ryan Gravel, the urban designer who dreamed up the city-shaping project as a graduate student at Georgia Tech, said rail transit is the &ldquo;centerpiece of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Beltline&rsquo;s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> vision and funding” <!-- raw HTML omitted -->according to Axios<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

			 <p>At some point yesterday, my Wordpress instance (thus the place where the thing you&rsquo;re reading right now came from) ran out of memory.</p>
<p>🤔 I suspect it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m asking it to do too much:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And all on a tiny underpowered VPS instance.</p>
<p>Now if I could have things my way, I&rsquo;d really prefer a clean install of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GoBlog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> like I had before but with an easier way to post photos, follow people thru RSS/#Fediverse, and connect to different networks in the same manner. Something like a Wordpress|Tumblr|<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Friendica<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mashup (basically smoosh <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefish<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Hubzilla together&hellip;) I decided to go back to using Wordpress instead becaus</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll make sure the thing is optimized. This also means not only the instance but the underlying supporting software too. I&rsquo;m pretty good at that part though since my day job also demands it. I&rsquo;m running this thing on Caddy (told you I was gonna force some Golang into my life!) and a very lean MariaDB container. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if I wind up making a Nix declaration for this set up and make it so I only need to back up one thing everyday to get back up and running instead of the three I need to do now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to optimize things around here and make it work the way I want it. I&rsquo;ll make sure to get a colophon page going really soon so I can let y&rsquo;all know how I did it; I still think this is the best way to enjoy the best of all worlds in the #fediverse and within the world of #indieweb enabled blogospheres.</p>
<p>If anyone has experience with any of the above, reach out to me via this post or just in general at @starrwulfe@starrwulfe.net, @starrwulfe@micro.blog or @starrwulfe@vivaldi.net</p>

I remember the Atlanta of the mid 1980&rsquo;s in my childhood, then again starting 10 years later in my early adult years until 2000&ndash; then again for 3 years starting in 2005, and finally the present.</p>
<p>(You know I&rsquo;ll definitely be doing this for Japan whenever I wander back that way; from what I can tell, Shibuya is largely unrecognizable from even 2 years ago when I was last there.)</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was NYCMTA&rsquo;s Subway Day&ndash; On October 27, 1904 the New York City Subway started running it&rsquo;s then total length between City Hall downtown and 145th Street uptown past Harlem (which was literally countryside back in those days)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video they posted on their Threads/Instagram account showing all the different trains they&rsquo;ve run throughout their 119 years. My personal fav, the R33 Redbird is shown with the ⑦ train mark, just as I used to ride it 35 years ago when I was a kid heading to Corona and Shea Stadium with my dad.</p>

			 <p>I usually go and buy a new computing device once every 6 years or so.  This year my trusty Late 2017 Apple MacBook Pro i5 8GB/500GB is officially sunsetted. While I&rsquo;ve been eyeing a new Macbook to take its place, it would be one of the newer Apple Silicon M2 joints. But I really want to jump back into doing all my computing in Linux full time and also game more so&hellip; I&rsquo;m taking a chance here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of a modular laptop since it&rsquo;s kind of the only way I can get the specs and ports I want. Framework makes it possible by having this form factor that should never be obsolete; all the parts are user serviceable and replaceable including the motherboard, ports, screen, keyboard, and so on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p> </p>
<p>My config is the 16 inch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ryzen™ 9 7940HS - Radeon™ RX 7700S - 180W. That&rsquo;s right, there&rsquo;s a kick-ass discreet graphics card in there and it&rsquo;s user swappable! Whenever the new hotness comes along, or other modules like an extra battery or whatever is needed, its a simple 10 minute swap out needing only a screwdriver (which is also included).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bad news: I gotta wait until Spring 2024. The good news, I can save up the rest of the money by Spring 2024&ndash; this thing IS NOT cheap; about $1000 more than my current Mac was when I bought it new in 2017. BUT it will basically become the workhorse PC as I plan on using it for work, home-labbing, and gaming. Any tool you use to make your livelihood off of should have no expense spared (within reason.)</p>

<p>The whole reason the Beltline even exists is because it was meant to be a transit corridor. A multiuse trail was also part of the design, so both need to be constructed.</p>
<p>But also, since the land developers jumped into the fray and built their car-oriented buildings off the trail, OF COURSE they want to keep it this way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick and tired of the false notion that transit BRINGS IN undesirable effects when the exact opposite has always been true.
Let&rsquo;s look at their concerns and I&rsquo;ll chime in with my opinions on why it&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>
